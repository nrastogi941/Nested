# #  the __str__() method is a special method that defines how an instance of a model should be represented as a string.

# # Example : Sure, here's an example to help illustrate how the __str__() method works:

# Let's say we have a Book model that has a title, author, and published_date field:

# without using ___str__() method:

# class Book(models.Model):
#     title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
#     author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
#     published_date = models.DateField()

# By default, if we create an instance of the Book model and try to print it or display it in the Django admin interface, we'll get a representation that looks something like this:

# >>> book = Book.objects.create(title='The Catcher in the Rye', author='J.D. Salinger', published_date='1951-07-16')
# >>> print(book)
# <Book: Book object (1)>   (yhh output print hoga i.e instance object)

# This isn't very helpful, since it doesn't tell us anything about the book itself. To make the representation more informative, we can define the __str__() method for the Book model:

# Using ___str__() method:


# class Book(models.Model):
#     title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
#     author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
#     published_date = models.DateField()

#     def __str__(self):
#         return f"{self.title} by {self.author} ({self.published_date})" 

# Now, when we create an instance of the Book model and print it or display it in the Django admin interface, we'll get a representation that looks like this:

# python
# Copy code
# >>> book = Book.objects.create(title='The Catcher in the Rye', author='J.D. Salinger', published_date='1951-07-16')
# >>> print(book)
# The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger (1951-07-16)     (yhh output print hoga insted of print instace object)

# This is much more informative and makes it easier to identify the book in question.
